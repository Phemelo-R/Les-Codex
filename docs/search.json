    "text": "Welcome to Les Codex â€” a digital companion for those beginning, refining, or critically engaging with R and machine learning. This site serves as both a structured archive and a dynamic learning space. At its core, it offers a gradual yet rigorous introduction to statistical programming with R, foregrounding practical applications without neglecting conceptual clarity.\nThe content is organised to ease transitions between foundational concepts and advanced topics. Beginners will find scaffolding for essential syntax, data structures, and plotting. As you progress, youâ€™ll encounter materials that draw from quantitative ecology, biostatistics, and machine learning â€” areas that demand both algorithmic precision and epistemic care.\nThis is not a passive repository of tutorials. It is intended to sharpen your sense of inquiry, to cultivate a habit of testing assumptions, and to familiarise you with tools that distinguish signal from noise. You are encouraged to move back and forth between the sections, treat examples as modifiable experiments, and reflect critically on how code interacts with data and method.\n\n\n\n\nLiteracy in R: By engaging with the early modules, you will learn the grammar of R, how to write clean and purposeful code, and how to structure analyses in a reproducible manner.\nAnalytical Thinking: Through exposure to worked examples, simulation models, and applied problems, youâ€™ll build an instinct for structured inference and statistical reasoning.\nPathway to Machine Learning: The later stages of the site introduce supervised and unsupervised learning using tidymodels, with emphasis on interpretability and model evaluation rather than hype.\nScientific Integrity: Beyond technical fluency, the material aims to nurture a disposition attentive to scale, uncertainty, and the philosophical dimensions of modelling.\n\nThis site is maintained as a living document. Contributions, criticisms, and alternative approaches are welcome â€” the goal is not completeness, but clarity and seriousness.\n\nLes Codex is for the reader who values careful work, conceptual grounding, and practical experimentation. It is not a fast track â€” it is a foundation.\n\n\n\nCreated with ðŸ’» by Phemelo Rutlokoane"

Developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, R has grown into an open-source project maintained by the R Core Team. It excels in data manipulation, statistical modelling, and rich visualizations.\n\n\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Created by JJ Allaire and the RStudio team, it provides a user-friendly interface with syntax highlighting, code completion, and tools for plotting, history, and workspace management.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Source: Free to use and extend.\nCommunity: A vast ecosystem of packages (CRAN, Bioconductor).\nFlexibility: From basic statistics to advanced machine learning and data science.\nReproducibility: Integrates with R Markdown and Quarto for reproducible reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload R: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/\n\nRun the installer and follow the prompts.\nDownload RStudio Desktop: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\nInstall RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload R: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\n\nInstall the .pkg file.\n\nDownload RStudio Desktop: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\nInstall RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow your distributionâ€™s instructions: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/\n\nInstall via package manager (e.g., sudo apt install r-base).\n\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudioâ€™s default layout consists of four key panes arranged in a 2x2 grid. You can customise this arrangement via View â†’ Panes â†’ Pane Layout.\n\nSource Editor (Top-Left)\n\nContains your script or Quarto document.\nFeatures line numbering, syntax highlighting, and code folding (collapse/expand blocks).\nUse Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+N (macOS) to create a new script.\n\nConsole (Bottom-Left)\n\nExecutes R commands interactively.\nShows directly evaluated expressions and error messages.\nYou can run selected code from the Source with Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter.\n\nEnvironment/History (Top-Right)\n\nEnvironment tab lists current objects: variables, data frames, functions.\nHistory tab records all commands youâ€™ve executed in the console.\nClick the broom icon in Environment to clear workspace.\n\nFiles/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (Bottom-Right)\n\nFiles: Browse project files; open by double-clicking.\nPlots: Shows generated graphs; use arrows to navigate past plots.\nPackages: Install, update, and load packages with checkboxes.\nHelp: Access documentation for functions and packages; search by term.\nViewer: Renders HTML outputs, such as Quarto previews or shiny apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes: Change editor theme under Tools â†’ Global Options â†’ Appearance. Options include light (TextMate, Solarized Light) and dark (Cobalt, Monokai).\nPane Layout: Move panes around under View â†’ Panes â†’ Pane Layoutâ€¦; drag and swap quadrants.\nCode Completion: Ensure Enable code completion is ticked in Global Options â†’ Code â†’ Completion.\nAdd-Ons:\n\nGit/GitHub: Integrate under Global Options â†’ Git/SVN; enable version control for your project.\nAI Assistants: Use extensions like GitHub Copilot for RMarkdown via Tools â†’ Addins."
