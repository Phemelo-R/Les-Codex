# Introduction

This tutorial introduces linear mixed-effects models using `lme4` and `nlme`. We'll examine nested designs, random intercepts, and structured residuals.

```{r}

library(lme4)

# Create an example dataset
set.seed(123)
dataset <- data.frame(
  y = rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 3),
  x = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 50),
  group = rep(1:10, each = 10)
)

# Fit the model
model <- lmer(y ~ x + (1 | group), data = dataset)
summary(model)

```
